     <div class="about">
         <p>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, a protein that carries oxygen. Healthy red blood cells are round, and they move through small blood vessels to carry oxygen to all parts of the body. In someone who has SCD, the hemoglobin is abnormal,
              which causes the red blood cells to become hard and sticky and look like a C-shaped farm tool called a “sickle.” The sickle cells die early, which causes a constant shortage of red blood cells. Also, when they travel through small blood vessels, they get stuck and clog the blood flow. 
             This can cause pain and other serious 
             complications (health problems) such as infection, acute chest syndrome and stroke. 
             <br> <br><b>Types of SCD</b> 
              <br> There are several types of SCD. The specific type of SCD a person has depends on the genes they inherited from their parents. People with SCD inherit genes that contain instructions,
              or code, for abnormal hemoglobin.
              Below are the most common types of SCD 
              HbS 
              People who have this form of SCD inherit two genes, one from each parent, that code for hemoglobin “S.” Hemoglobin S is an abnormal form of hemoglobin that causes the red cells to become rigid, and sickle shaped. This is commonly called sickle cell anemia and is usually the most severe form of the disease.
              HbSC
              People who have this form of SCD inherit a hemoglobin “S” gene from one parent and a gene for a different type of abnormal hemoglobin called “C” from the other parent. This is usually a milder form of SCD.

    </div>
         <br>
    <div class="cause">
         <p>Sickle cell disease is inherited, meaning that it runs in families. People who have sickle cell 
                 disease inherit two faulty hemoglobin genes, called hemoglobin S — one from each parent. <br>
                 A person has sickle cell trait when the hemoglobin S gene is inherited from only one parent and a normal hemoglobin gene — hemoglobin A — is inherited from the other. 
                 People who have sickle cell trait are generally healthy.
                 <br> If someone has sickle cell trait, they are a carrier of the hemoglobin S gene. That means they can pass it on when they have a child.
                 If the child’s other parent also has sickle cell trait or another faulty hemoglobin gene, such as beta (β) thalassemia, hemoglobin C,
                  hemoglobin D, or hemoglobin E, that child has a chance of having sickle cell disease. That is because the child could inherit a faulty hemoglobin gene from each parent.

         </ul>
 </div>
    <div class="diagnosis">
         <p> If you do not know whether you make sickle hemoglobin, you can find out by having your blood tested. You may also have a genetic test performed on your blood. This way, 
             you can learn whether you carry a gene — or have the trait — for sickle hemoglobin that you could pass on to a child. <br>
             <br>Genetic testing can help determine which type of sickle cell disease you have or can help confirm a diagnosis if results from blood tests are not clear. Genetic
             testing can also tell whether you have one or two copies of the sickle hemoglobin gene.
             <br> <br> <br> <b>Prenatal screening</b> 
             <br>
             Healthcare providers can also diagnose sickle cell disease before a baby is born.
             This is done using either a sample of amniotic fluid, the liquid in the sac surrounding a growing embryo, or a sample of tissue taken from the placenta,
             the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the womb.

             Testing before birth can be done as early as 8 to 10 weeks into the pregnancy. This testing looks for the sickle hemoglobin gene rather than the abnormal hemoglobin itself. 
             This testing cannot predict the severity of the disease.
             <br><br>
             <br><b>Newborn screening</b>
              <br><br>
              In newborn screening programs, drops of blood from a heel prick are collected on a special type of paper. The hemoglobin from this blood is then tested in a lab. Newborn screening results are 
             sent to the provider who ordered the test and to your child’s healthcare provider.

          <p> A blood and bone marrow transplant is currently the only cure for some patients who have sickle cell disease. After early diagnosis,

             <br> <br>
              Babies who have sickle cell disease may see a hematologist, a doctor who specializes in blood diseases such as sickle cell disease. For newborns, 
              the first sickle cell disease visit should take place before 8 weeks of age.

               Voxelotor treats sickle cell disease in adults and children 4 years old and older. The oral medicine prevents red blood cells from forming the sickle shape and binding together. This may reduce the destruction of some red blood cells, 
              which in turn lowers the risk for anemia and improves blood flow to your organs.
             <br><br>
              Possible side effects include headache, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, fatigue, and fever. Rarely, allergic reactions may occur, causing rashes, hives, or mild shortness of 
             breath. Talk to your healthcare provider about other medicines you take.

             <b>Medicine to reduce vaso-occlusive and pain crises</b>
             <br>
              Crizanlizumab-tmca is approved for adults and children 16 years old and older who have sickle cell disease. The medicine, which is given through an intravenous (IV) line in the vein, helps prevent blood cells from sticking to blood vessel walls and causing blood flow blockage,
               inflammation, and pain crises.
              <br>Possible side effects include nausea, joint pain, back pain, and fever.

              Hydroxyurea is an oral medicine that has been shown to reduce or prevent several complications of sickle cell disease.
             Use in adults: Many studies of adults with hemoglobin SS or hemoglobin Sβ (sickle cell beta) thalassemia showed that hydroxyurea lowered the number of episodes of pain crises and acute chest syndrome. 
             It also improved anemia and reduced the need for transfusions and hospital admissions. <br> <br>
             Use in children: Studies in children with severe hemoglobin SS or Sβ thalassemia showed that hydroxyurea lowered the number of vaso-occlusive crises and hospitalizations. A study of children between the ages of 9 and 18 months who had hemoglobin SS or Sβ thalassemia also showed that hydroxyurea lowered the number of pain episodes and the incidence of dactylitis (painful swelling of the hands and feet). 
             There is no information about how safe or effective hydroxyurea is in children under 9 months old. <br>
             <br> Pregnancy: Pregnant people should not use hydroxyurea. <br><br>
              Use in adults: Many studies of adults with hemoglobin SS or hemoglobin Sβ (sickle cell beta) thalassemia showed that hydroxyurea lowered the number of episodes of pain crises and acute chest syndrome. It also improved anemia

        <p>People with sickle cell disease can live full lives and enjoy most of the activities that other people do. The following tips will help you, 
              or someone you know with sickle cell disease, stay as healthy as possible. <br> <br>
              <b>Find Good Medical Care</b> <br>
              Sickle cell disease is a complex disease. Good quality medical care from doctors and nurses
             who know a lot about the disease can help prevent some serious problems. Often the best choice is 
              a hematologist (a doctor who specializes in blood diseases) working with a team of specialists.
               <br><br><b>Get Regular Checkups</b>
               <br>Regular health checkups with a primary care doctor can help prevent some serious problems.
             <br>
             Babies from birth to 1 year of age should see a doctor every 2 to 3 months. <br>
             Children from 1 to 2 years of age should see a doctor at least every 3 months. <br>
             Children and adults from 2 years of age or older should see a doctor at least once every year.
             <br><br>
             <b>Learn Healthy Habits</b> <br>
             People with sickle cell disease should drink 8 to 10 glasses of water every day and eat healthy food. Try not to get too hot, too cold, or too tired.
             Children can, and should, participate in physical activity to help stay healthy. However, 
             it’s important that they don’t overdo it, rest when tired, and drink plenty of water.
